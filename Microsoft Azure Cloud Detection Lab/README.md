In this lab I created a Resource Group to manage related resources and deploying a Windows 10 Virtual Machine within it. Using best practices in security I was able to add Just-In-Time access for added security. Microsoft Defender for the cloud was also enabled. A Log Analytics Workspace is established for log monitoring, and Microsoft Sentinel is set up to analyze data. Data connectors for Windows Security Events are configured, and users connect to the VM via RDP to analyze event logs. I used Kusto Query Language to query event logs. Local security policy was configured to log object access events, and a simulated malicious scheduled task is created for testing. An alert rule is written in Microsoft Sentinel to detect the fake event, demonstrating incident detection and response capabilities.
