Kali Linux is a powerful distribution packed with security and penetration testing tools. But what if you don’t want to dedicate your whole hard drive to it? This is where a bootable Kali Linux USB drive comes in.

Here are some of the advantages of creating a Kali Linux USB drive

Safe Experimentation — A bootable USB drive runs Kali Linux independently, leaving your existing setup untouched.
It’s a Portable Cybersecurity Toolkit — You can carry Kali Linux in your pocket and have it running in a matter of minutes.
It’s customizable — You are able to roll your own custom Kali Linux ISO image that includes only the security tools you need for specific tasks.
Persistent Workflow option- By configuring your Kali USB drive for persistence, you can save downloaded tools, configurations, and even test results across reboots. The persistent storage option will significantly enhance productivity.
What You Will Need
A verified copy of the appropriate ISO image of the latest Kali build image for the system you’ll be running it on.
The ability to download the software, Rufus
A USB thumb drive, 4GB or larger.
Downloading the Bootable Drive ISO image

First, go to the Kali Linux official site

Select the “Get KALI” tab at the top

Now scroll down to where you see “Live Boot”

Download the most recent image available for download (in my case Kali 2024.1)

Downloading Rufus

Now we will need to make the drive bootable from the ISO image that we’ve recently downloaded. Rufus is a free open-source platform that will allow us to do so.

Go to the official Rufus site and download the latest version.

Creating the Bootable Kali USB Drive on Windows

Plug you USB drive into an available USB port on your Windows machine.
With Rufus open under “Device”, check the dropdown list of options for the USB drive.
Under “Boot Selection", select the Kali Linux ISO file.
Under “Persistent partition size” there’s an option to choose how much persistent storage you would like to dedicate to the USB. This will vary depending on how much you would like to use.
Select the START button once ready

You may get a prompt stating that all data will be removed on USB. To proceed with this you will have to select “ok”

Be prepared for this installation to take around 15 minutes to complete.

Reboot / BIOS

Now every machine is a little different so I’ll give you the task but the steps will be unique to the machine you are on.

We will need to reboot the computer into BIOS. This is different for every machine, I recommend you search what key combination is required to restart the computer into BIOS

Once in BIOS you will want to set the boot priority to the USB flash drive first and then Windows second.

From there you will want to find the Secure Boot control in the BIOS and Disable that feature.

Once you save changes you should have Kali Linux up!!

When you get to the screen below make sure to select “Live USB Encrypted Persistence” . This allows for the preservation of data on the Kali Live USB drive across reboots.


There you have it!!

I hope this tutorial was helpful. Make sure to use Kali Linux responsibly and ethically.
